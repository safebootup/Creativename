Workplace for rounds styled fighting game

For the final project I intend on making a rounds styled game but as a 2D party fighter. To explain the premise there will be two players facing against each other over around x many of rounds. the winner of the round stays as is but the loser gets the ability to select a buff that will give them the edge in the upcoming round. Repeat the process x many of times and the winner of most rounds wins. Now going into the actual game aspect rather than using buffs I plan on adding moves in general. The game will start with the players only being able to move and attack and as you lose you will be able to choose from around 3-5 random abilities like jumping, crouching, blocking, specials, meter, etc. Hopefully this will lead to a counterplay system where if the first loser chooses jumping and spams aerial attacks the previous winner can then choose blocking to punish the spammer. Because this will be more like a demo I expect both characters to have the same possible moves.

I plan on collaborating with Wei-Lun Chang

I do not have any questions.
