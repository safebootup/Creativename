For the final project I intend on making a rounds styled game but as a 2D party fighter. To explain the premise there will be two players facing against each other over around x many of rounds. the winner of the round stays as is but the loser gets the ability to select a buff that will give them the edge in the upcoming round. Repeat the process x many of times and the winner of most rounds wins. Now going into the actual game aspect rather than using buffs I plan on adding moves in general. The game will start with the players only being able to move and attack and as you lose you will be able to choose from around 3-5 random abilities like jumping, crouching, blocking, specials, meter, etc. Hopefully this will lead to a counterplay system where if the first loser chooses jumping and spams aerial attacks the previous winner can then choose blocking to punish the spammer. Because this will be more like a demo I expect both characters to have the same possible moves.

I plan on collaborating with Wei-Lun Chang

I do not have any questions.

What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Creativename

In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
A Python fighting game where two players get mechanics by losing.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
It will be a python file ran in the idle shell that boots up a screen with the game. After being run the game should start with both characters at 500 hp and only the ability to move and attack. every other mechanic should be locked behind losing 2 rounds. Once you lose 2 rounds you should get a random amount of mechanics to choose from.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
We will ATLEAST come out with a working fighting game. A better outcome will be including the rounds mechanic even if its only just like jump or block. The best outcome would be everything

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
We will need to research a lot based off of what python module we will be using since we have no clue where to start. I will most likely code the basics while Wei-Lun programs different mechanics like jumping while we both split Spritework.
